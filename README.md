Preline UI is an open-source set of prebuilt UI components based on the utility-first Tailwind CSS framework.

## Why use Preline UI?

Based on the Tailwind CSS utility classes, Preline UI's prebuilt components and UI elements help you quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first websites with the components a website needs, including buttons, dropdowns, navigation bars, modals, and more.

## What's in the box?

Components are grouped by visual usability criteria (components, navigation, forms, etc.) and styled directly on top of Tailwind CSS, making them easy to extend and customize. This is a lifesaver for developers looking to create a unique and eye-catching design system without the hassle of creating each component by hand.

## Getting Started

### Quick Setup

This guide will help you get started with Preline UI, including how to run, customize, update, and integrate your project!

First, you need to make sure that you have a working <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> project installed and that you also have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a> installed on your machine.

### Require via NPM

1. Install <code>preline</code> via npm

<pre><code>npm i preline</code></pre>

2. Include Preline UI as a plugin in the <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file

<pre><code>module.exports = {
  content: [
    'node_modules/preline/dist/*.js'
  ],
  plugins: [
    require('preline/plugin')
  ],
}</code></pre>

3. Include the JavaScript <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> that powers the interactive elements near the end of your <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag:

<pre><code><script src="./node_modules/preline/dist/preline.js"></script></code></pre>

### Use with NextJS and TypeScript

1. See [The NextJS example](/examples/nextjs-typescript/) for a complete example

2. Add Preline UI to the <code>packages.json</code>

<pre><code>npm i preline</code></pre>

3. Add Preline UI to the <code>tailwind.config.js</code>

<pre><code>module.exports = {
  content: [
    ...
    'node_modules/preline/dist/*.js',
  ],
  plugins: [
    ...
    require('preline/plugin'),
  ],
}</code></pre>

4. To support TypeScript, add a file called <code>preline.d.ts</code> to your project containing the single line below:

<pre><code>
declare module 'preline';
</code></pre>

5. Add a <code>prelineLoader.tsx</code> component to your project to load Preline JavaScript client-side

<pre><code>'use client'

import { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function PrelineLoader() {
  useEffect(() => {
    import('preline');
  }, []);
  
  return <></>;
}</code></pre>

6. Reference the <code>PrelineLoader</code> component in your <code>layout.tsx</code>

<pre><code>
...
import PrelineLoader from './prelineLoader'
...
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <PrelineLoader />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}</code></pre>
